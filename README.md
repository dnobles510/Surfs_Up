## Surfs_Up June and December Analysis

# Overview
The overview of this analysis is to figure out if June and December's temperatures are sustainable enough for a year-round surfing/icecream business.

# Results
- June had an average of 75 degrees with the minimum being 58 and the maximum being 87. 
- December had an average of 73 degrees with a minimum of 58 and a maximum of 87.

# Summary
These temperatures are very good temperatures for both surfing and ice cream. On days where the weather is around 58 degrees, the business will more than likely experience slow days. Overall I believe the business is capable of being a successful year-round business.
